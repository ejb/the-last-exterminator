# The Last Exterminator

This small and very stupid game is my entry for [VOGJam 2014](http://www.vognetwork.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=835). The theme was "a buggy game".

## Things used to make game

- Engine is [PixelJS](http://www.pixeljs.com) (not sure if I recommend; it's lacking many features)
- Sounds made using [cfxr](http://thirdcog.eu/apps/cfxr)
